# Specification Quality Checklist: Simplify Profile Suppliers with SOLID Pattern

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-01-20  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality**:
- ✅ Specification focuses on WHAT (user needs) not HOW (implementation)
- ✅ Written in plain language accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) completed

**Requirement Completeness**:
- ✅ All 15 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- ✅ Success criteria include specific metrics (e.g., "under 20 seconds", "under 200 lines")
- ✅ Success criteria are user/business focused, not implementation-focused
- ✅ 6 acceptance scenarios cover all primary flows (create, edit, delete)
- ✅ 6 edge cases identified with expected behaviors
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded with 8 out-of-scope items
- ✅ 6 dependencies and 7 assumptions documented

**Feature Readiness**:
- ✅ Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios
- ✅ Three prioritized user stories (2 P1, 1 P2) with independent test criteria
- ✅ Measurable outcomes include time savings, code reduction, and consistency metrics
- ✅ No mention of React, Next.js, tRPC, or other implementation details in requirements

**Made Informed Guesses For**:
- Material type options (PVC, ALUMINUM, WOOD, MIXED) - assumed these are standard industry types
- Field validation rules (name: 3-100 chars, notes: max 500 chars) - based on existing implementation
- Performance targets (20s create, 15s edit, 10s delete) - reasonable estimates for modal-based CRUD
- Network latency assumption (<2s) - standard web app expectation
- Empty state messaging - standard UX pattern for empty lists

**No Clarifications Needed**: All critical decisions have reasonable defaults based on:
1. Existing Services module implementation (proven pattern)
2. Current profile-supplier-form.tsx implementation (validation rules, fields)
3. Industry-standard UX patterns (dialog modals, confirmation dialogs)
4. Project architecture constraints (SSR, tRPC, Prisma schema)

## Ready for Next Phase

✅ **Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`**

The specification provides clear, testable requirements without implementation details. All edge cases are covered, success criteria are measurable, and the scope is well-defined. The Services module provides a proven reference implementation, minimizing technical risk.
