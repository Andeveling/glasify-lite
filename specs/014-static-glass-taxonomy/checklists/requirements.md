# Specification Quality Checklist: Static Glass Taxonomy Based on Industry Standards

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-01-21  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Specification is COMPLETE and READY** for `/speckit.plan` phase.

### Validation Summary:

✅ **Content Quality**: All sections focus on business value without technical implementation details. Glass taxonomy described in terms of industry standards (Tecnoglass, ISO, ASTM) rather than database schemas or code.

✅ **Requirements**: All 10 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-010) are testable and unambiguous. Each requirement specifies a measurable capability without dictating how to implement it.

✅ **Success Criteria**: All 6 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-006) are technology-agnostic and measurable:
- SC-001: 100% accuracy against manufacturer datasheets
- SC-002: Zero data loss during migration
- SC-003: 2-minute supplier management time
- SC-004: 500ms catalog load time
- SC-005: 90% reduction in support tickets
- SC-006: Standardized permit documentation

✅ **User Scenarios**: 4 independently testable user stories prioritized (3 P1, 1 P2). Each story describes user value and can be implemented/tested in isolation.

✅ **Edge Cases**: 4 edge cases identified with clear resolutions (migration conflicts, empty associations, soft delete, tenant isolation).

✅ **Scope Boundaries**: "Out of Scope" section explicitly excludes 6 features (custom types, real-time sync, multi-language, pricing, automated migration).

✅ **Dependencies**: 5 critical dependencies identified (Tecnoglass data, existing CRUD preservation, quote model FKs, tenant isolation, Prisma seeds).

✅ **Assumptions**: 6 documented assumptions about industry standards, data authority, update frequency, regional suppliers, nomenclature, and soft delete sufficiency.

### Ready for Next Phase:

The specification is complete and can proceed directly to `/speckit.plan` for task breakdown without requiring clarifications.
