- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **PASS** - Specification is free from implementation details. No mentions of Next.js, React, tRPC, Prisma, or specific technologies. Focus remains on what admins need to do and why.

✅ **PASS** - All content is user/business-focused. Requirements describe capabilities from admin perspective (create, edit, view, delete entities) rather than system internals.

✅ **PASS** - Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders. Uses business terms (models, glass types, services, suppliers) rather than technical jargon.

✅ **PASS** - All mandatory sections completed: User Scenarios (7 stories with priorities), Requirements (50 functional requirements), Success Criteria (10 measurable outcomes), Key Entities (11 entities).

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. All requirements are concrete and actionable.

✅ **PASS** - All 50 functional requirements are testable with verifiable outcomes (e.g., "System MUST allow admins to create...", "System MUST prevent deletion...").

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria include specific metrics:
- Time-based: "under 3 minutes", "under 5 minutes", "under 30 seconds", "under 2 seconds"
- Percentage-based: "100% of invalid deletion attempts", "80% reduction in failed submissions"
- Qualitative: "without technical assistance"

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are technology-agnostic. No mentions of frameworks, databases, or implementation tools. Focus on user-observable outcomes.

✅ **PASS** - All 7 user stories include detailed acceptance scenarios (43 scenarios total) with Given-When-Then format.

✅ **PASS** - Edge cases section identifies 8 critical scenarios:
- Deletion of referenced entities
- Invalid glass type selections
- Invalid dimension constraints
- Inactive supplier assignments
- Invalid pricing values
- Missing price change reasons
- Duplicate entry attempts
- Unsaved form changes

✅ **PASS** - Scope is clearly bounded through:
- 7 prioritized user stories (P1-P3)
- Focus on CRUD operations for 7 catalog entity types
- Admin-only access restriction
- Explicit exclusion of public catalog rendering (noted as separate system)

✅ **PASS** - Assumptions section identifies 10 dependencies:
- Admin training requirements
- Database precision support
- Authentication system configuration
- Public catalog integration
- Localization standards
- Form pattern conventions
- Active/inactive filtering behavior
- Price history automation approach
- Icon library availability
- Pagination/filtering support

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - Each of the 50 functional requirements maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories. Requirements are verifiable through the defined scenarios.

✅ **PASS** - User scenarios cover all primary flows:
- Create operations (7 entity types)
- Read/list operations with filtering
- Update operations
- Delete operations with referential integrity
- Price history tracking
- Many-to-many relationship management (solutions, characteristics)

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria align with user stories:
- SC-001/SC-002: Creation speed (User Stories 1-2)
- SC-003: Search/filter efficiency (all stories)
- SC-004: Data integrity protection (all deletion scenarios)
- SC-005: Audit trail (price history in User Stories 1-2)
- SC-006: Validation UX (all form interactions)
- SC-007: List performance (all list views)
- SC-008: Authorization (FR-041)
- SC-009: Referential integrity (all delete scenarios)
- SC-010: Usability (all user stories)

✅ **PASS** - Specification maintains abstraction. Implementation details are relegated to assumptions (e.g., "Forms follow existing project patterns" rather than "Use React Hook Form").

## Notes

**Specification Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is:
- Complete with 7 prioritized user stories
- Testable with 43 acceptance scenarios
- Measurable with 10 quantified success criteria
- Technology-agnostic throughout
- Properly scoped with clear assumptions

**Next Steps**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan.

**Key Strengths**:
1. Comprehensive coverage of all 7 catalog entities (Model, GlassType, Service, ProfileSupplier, GlassSupplier, GlassSolution, GlassCharacteristic)
2. Clear priority ordering (P1: Models → P2: Glass Types & Suppliers → P3: Services & Metadata)
3. Strong focus on data integrity (referential integrity, price history audit trails)
4. Detailed edge case analysis covering validation, deletion constraints, and UX scenarios
5. Well-defined cross-cutting concerns (authorization, validation, logging)

**Potential Considerations for Planning Phase**:
- UI/UX patterns for managing many-to-many relationships (glass type solutions/characteristics)
- Form complexity management (Model form has 15+ fields)
- Bulk operations implementation strategy (FR-050)
- Price history automation approach (database triggers vs application layer)
- Icon selection UX for glass solutions
