## Phase 1: Dashboard Layout Infrastructure üéØ UI Foundation

**Purpose**: Implement standardized dashboard layout using Shadcn/ui sidebar components from dashboard-01 block

**Context**: Recently added Shadcn/ui dashboard-01 block (https://ui.shadcn.com/blocks) via `npx shadcn@latest add dashboard-01`. This phase sets up the admin dashboard layout before implementing any CRUD features.

**Goal**: Create a consistent admin layout with sidebar navigation and standardized content container that will be used by all admin pages.

**Independent Test**: Navigate to `/dashboard/admin`, verify sidebar appears with navigation items, test responsive behavior (sidebar collapses on mobile), verify content area has proper spacing and max-width constraints.

### Implementation Tasks

- [x] T001 Create admin dashboard layout in `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/layout.tsx` (Server Component with AppSidebar integration)
- [x] T002 [P] Configure AppSidebar navigation data in `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/layout.tsx` (nav items for all 7 entity types: Models, Glass Types, Services, Profile Suppliers, Glass Suppliers, Solutions, Characteristics)
- [x] T003 [P] Create standardized content container component in `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/_components/admin-content-container.tsx` (consistent padding, max-width, responsive spacing)
- [x] T004 [P] Create admin dashboard home page in `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/page.tsx` (Server Component with overview stats/cards)
- [x] T005 [P] Update SidebarProvider configuration in admin layout (default open state, collapsible behavior)
- [x] T006 [P] Customize NavMain component styling for admin section in admin layout (if needed for branding/theme)
- [x] T007 [P] Add breadcrumbs component in `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/_components/admin-breadcrumbs.tsx` (shows current location in admin section)
- [x] T008 Verify mobile responsiveness: sidebar drawer functionality on small screens
- [x] T009 Verify keyboard navigation and accessibility (ARIA labels, focus management)

**Available Components** (from `src/components/`):
- `app-sidebar.tsx` - Main sidebar component ‚úÖ
- `nav-main.tsx` - Main navigation list ‚úÖ
- `nav-secondary.tsx` - Secondary navigation ‚úÖ
- `nav-user.tsx` - User profile section ‚úÖ
- `ui/sidebar.tsx` - Sidebar primitives ‚úÖ

**Checkpoint**: Admin layout infrastructure complete - all admin pages will use this consistent layout

---

## Phase 2: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure (already exists, verify setup)

- [x] T010 Verify Next.js 15 App Router structure in `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/`
- [x] T011 Verify tRPC router structure in `src/server/api/routers/admin/`
- [x] T012 [P] Verify Prisma schema entities (Model, GlassType, Service, ProfileSupplier, GlassSupplier, GlassSolution, GlassCharacteristic) in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- [x] T013 [P] Verify authentication middleware for admin routes in `src/middleware.ts`
- [x] T014 [P] Verify Winston logger configuration in `src/lib/logger.ts`

- T009 Glass price history service
- T010 Delete confirmation dialog
- T011 Admin navigation

**Phases 3-6 (Foundation Entities) - All phases can run in parallel:**
- ProfileSupplier (T013-T022)
- GlassSupplier (T023-T032)
- GlassSolution (T033-T042)
- GlassCharacteristic (T043-T052)

**Within Each User Story - All [P] tasks can run in parallel:**
- Schema files
- Page files (list, new, edit)
- Component files (list, form)

**Phase 1 (Dashboard Layout) - Most [P] tasks can run in parallel:**
- T002-T007 can be done in parallel once T001 (layout) is complete

**Phase 3 (Foundational) - All [P] tasks can run in parallel:**
- T017 Model price history service
- T018 Glass price history service
- T019 Delete confirmation dialog
- T020 Admin navigation

**Phase 11 (Polish) - All [P] tasks can run in parallel:**
- All test writing tasks (T099-T110)
- Documentation tasks (T111-T112)

## Parallel Example: Foundation Entities (Phases 4-7)

Once Phase 3 (Foundational) is complete, all 4 foundation entities can be implemented in parallel by different team members:

```bash
# Developer A: ProfileSupplier (Phase 4)
Tasks: T022-T031 (10 tasks)
Time estimate: ~4-6 hours

# Developer B: GlassSupplier (Phase 5)
Tasks: T032-T041 (10 tasks)
Time estimate: ~4-6 hours

# Developer C: GlassSolution (Phase 6)
Tasks: T042-T051 (10 tasks)
Time estimate: ~4-6 hours

# Developer D: GlassCharacteristic (Phase 7)
Tasks: T052-T061 (10 tasks)
Time estimate: ~4-6 hours

Total parallel time: ~4-6 hours (vs ~16-24 hours sequential)
```

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 120 tasks (updated from 111 - added Phase 1 Dashboard Layout)
- **Dashboard Layout (Phase 1)**: 9 tasks (UI foundation with Shadcn/ui sidebar)
- **Setup (Phase 2)**: 5 tasks (verification)
- **Foundational (Phase 3)**: 7 tasks (blocking prerequisites)
- **US4 ProfileSupplier (Phase 4)**: 10 tasks
- **US5 GlassSupplier (Phase 5)**: 10 tasks
- **US6 GlassSolution (Phase 6)**: 10 tasks
- **US7 GlassCharacteristic (Phase 7)**: 10 tasks
- **US2 GlassType (Phase 8)**: 14 tasks (complex with solutions/characteristics)
- **US1 Model (Phase 9)**: 13 tasks (complex with cost breakdown) ‚úÖ **MVP**
- **US3 Service (Phase 10)**: 10 tasks
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: 22 tasks (testing + documentation)

**Task Distribution by User Story**:
- US1 (Model): 13 tasks - Priority P1 - MVP Core
- US2 (GlassType): 14 tasks - Priority P2 - Required for MVP
- US3 (Service): 10 tasks - Priority P3 - Post-MVP
- US4 (ProfileSupplier): 10 tasks - Priority P2 - Foundation for US1
- US5 (GlassSupplier): 10 tasks - Priority P3 - Foundation for US2
- US6 (GlassSolution): 10 tasks - Priority P3 - Foundation for US2
- US7 (GlassCharacteristic): 10 tasks - Priority P3 - Foundation for US2

**Parallel Opportunities Identified**: 
- Phase 1: 7 parallel tasks (dashboard layout components)
- Phase 3: 5 parallel tasks (foundational services)
- Phases 4-7: All 4 phases can run in parallel (40 tasks total)
- Phase 8-9: Some tasks within each phase can run in parallel
- Phase 11: 18 parallel tasks (all test writing)

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Each user story has clear "Independent Test" criteria defined
- ‚úÖ Each user story can be tested without other stories being complete
- ‚úÖ MVP is clearly marked (US1 Model after US4, US2 complete)
- ‚úÖ Dashboard layout can be tested independently (Phase 1)

**Suggested MVP Scope**: 
- Phase 1: Dashboard Layout (UI foundation) üéØ **NEW**
- Phase 2-3: Setup + Foundational
- Phase 4-7: All Foundation Entities
- Phase 8: US2 GlassType  
- Phase 9: US1 Model
- **Result**: Admin has consistent dashboard layout with sidebar navigation, can manage models, glass types, and all their dependencies (suppliers, solutions, characteristics)

**Format Validation**: ‚úÖ All tasks follow checklist format with:
- Checkbox `- [ ]`
- Task ID (T001-T120)
- [P] marker where applicable
- [Story] label (US1-US7) where applicable
- Clear description with exact file paths
