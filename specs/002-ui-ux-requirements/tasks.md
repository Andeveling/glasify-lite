## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: Next.js 15 App Router, shadcn/ui v3, Tailwind v4, tRPC, Prisma
   → Structure: Route groups (public), (auth), (dashboard) with English routes
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Modelo, GlassType, Service, Quote, QuoteItem entities
   → contracts/: tRPC contracts (catalog, quote) + UI navigation patterns
   → research.md: App Router with route groups, shadcn/ui, NextAuth v5
   → quickstart.md: Validation criteria and success metrics
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Project structure, dependencies, route groups
   → Tests: Contract tests for tRPC endpoints, UI integration tests
   → Core: UI components, pages, navigation flows using Next.js conventions
   → Integration: Route handlers, middleware, state management
   → Polish: Accessibility, performance, error states using Next.js special files
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different route groups/files = [P] for parallel development
   → Same file/component = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
   → Use Next.js special files explicitly (loading.tsx, error.tsx, not-found.tsx, etc.)
5. Tasks numbered T001-T060+ with dependencies and clear Next.js file paths
6. Focus on UI/UX implementation leveraging all Next.js App Router features
```

## English Route Structure with Spanish Content
```
/                           → Redirect to /catalog
/catalog                    → Glass catalog (Public route group)
/catalog/[modelId]          → Model detail (Public route group)
/quote                      → Quote creation (Public route group)
/quote/review               → Quote review (Public route group)
/signin                     → Sign in (Auth route group)
/dashboard                  → Dashboard home (Protected route group)
/dashboard/models           → Model management (Protected route group)
/dashboard/quotes           → Quote management (Protected route group)
/dashboard/settings         → Settings (Protected route group)
```

## Next.js Special Files Usage
- **loading.tsx**: Loading UI states for each route group
- **error.tsx**: Error boundaries with recovery actions for each route group  
- **not-found.tsx**: 404 pages with contextual navigation for each route group
- **global-error.tsx**: Root-level error boundary for catastrophic failures
- **template.tsx**: Re-rendered layouts for route transitions (optional)
- **default.tsx**: Fallback for parallel routes (future use)

## Architecture Benefits
- **Screaming Architecture**: Route groups clearly separate domains (public, auth, dashboard)
- **Component Co-location**: Components live close to where they're used
- **English Routes**: Clean English URLs for SEO and consistency
- **Spanish Content**: All UI text and validation messages in Spanish (es-LA)
- **Explicit Error Handling**: Next.js special files provide clear error boundaries
- **Parallel Development**: Different route groups can be developed simultaneously
- **Clear Loading States**: Each route group has contextual loading experiences
- **Scalable Structure**: Easy to add new features within existing route groups

## Notes
- **[P] tasks**: Different files/route groups that can be developed in parallel
- **English routes**: Clean URLs for consistency with codebase 
- **Spanish content**: All UI text, validation messages, and user content in Spanish (es-LA)
- **Next.js conventions**: Use explicit special files (loading.tsx, error.tsx, not-found.tsx)
- **CSS variables**: Use variables from `src/styles/globals.css`, no hardcoded colors
- **TDD approach**: Verify tests fail before implementing features
- **Route groups**: Natural boundaries for parallel development and different behaviors
- **Component co-location**: Components live in `_components/` folders near their usage
- **Screaming architecture**: Project structure screams about the business domains
- **TanStack Query v5**: State management and caching with React Server Components
- **NextAuth v5**: Admin route protection with middleware
- **Accessibility first**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance from the start

## Performance & Accessibility Requirements
- **Price calculations**: Must respond <200ms (SLA from contracts)
- **Catalog loading**: Must be <500ms with proper loading states
- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance**: Mandatory across all route groups
- **Mobile-first**: Responsive design starting from mobile breakpoints
- **Browser support**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Spanish locale**: Proper semantic HTML with lang="es-LA"
- **Loading states**: Each route group must have contextual loading experiences
- **Error recovery**: Error boundaries must provide clear recovery actions

## Task Generation Rules for Agents
- **Route groups**: Enable parallel development of different business domains
- **Component co-location**: Components are placed close to their usage context
- **English file/folder names**: Consistent with codebase conventions
- **Spanish user content**: All user-facing text in Spanish (es-LA)
- **Next.js special files**: Explicit usage for loading, error, and not-found states
- **Tests first**: All contract and integration tests must fail before implementation
- **Accessibility throughout**: Not just at the end, but considered in every task
- **Performance by design**: Loading states and optimizations built-in from start
- **Manual validation**: Final testing validates complete user journey per quickstart.md
