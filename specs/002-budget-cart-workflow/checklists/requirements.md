# Specification Quality Checklist: Budget Cart Workflow with Authentication

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-09  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality ✅
- **Pass**: Specification describes WHAT users need (cart management, quote generation) without mentioning HOW (React, tRPC, Prisma, etc.)
- **Pass**: Focus on user value - building multi-item budgets, authentication for quote ownership, tracking quote history
- **Pass**: Written in business language - no technical jargon, clear user journeys
- **Pass**: All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

### Requirement Completeness ✅
- **Pass**: Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all decisions made with reasonable defaults:
  - Cart persistence: session storage (standard web practice)
  - Price locking: at quote generation time (common business practice)
  - Authentication: Google OAuth (already configured in project)
  - Quote validity: 15 days (specified in requirements)
  - Item naming: model prefix + sequence (follows "Don't Make Me Think" principle)

- **Pass**: All requirements testable:
  - FR-001: Can verify "Add to Cart" button exists in form
  - FR-002: Can test name generation produces "VEKA-001", "VEKA-002" pattern
  - FR-009: Can verify authentication redirect occurs
  - FR-014: Can validate quote has correct validUntil date
  
- **Pass**: Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
  - SC-001: "under 5 minutes" - measurable with stopwatch
  - SC-002: "95% success rate" - measurable with analytics
  - SC-003: "100% accuracy" - measurable by data comparison
  - SC-004: "under 500ms" - measurable with performance tools
  - No mention of React, databases, or specific technologies

- **Pass**: All acceptance scenarios defined with Given/When/Then format for 5 user stories
- **Pass**: 7 edge cases identified covering session expiry, price changes, network failures, OAuth cancellation
- **Pass**: Scope clearly bounded - cart management, authentication, quote generation, quote history (no quote editing, sharing, or payment)
- **Pass**: Dependencies identified - existing Google OAuth config, existing model form, existing Prisma schema

### Feature Readiness ✅
- **Pass**: All 23 functional requirements map to user scenarios and have acceptance criteria
- **Pass**: 5 user scenarios cover complete workflow: add to cart → manage cart → authenticate → generate quote → view history
- **Pass**: 7 success criteria define measurable outcomes for user experience, performance, and data integrity
- **Pass**: No implementation leakage - entities described conceptually (CartItem, Quote) without database or code specifics

## Notes

**Specification Quality**: EXCELLENT

The specification is complete, well-structured, and ready for planning phase. Key strengths:

1. **Clear Prioritization**: User stories properly prioritized (P1 for core cart/auth/quote flow, P2 for management features)
2. **Independent Testability**: Each story can be developed and tested independently (P1 stories deliver MVP)
3. **Comprehensive Edge Cases**: Covers session management, price changes, network failures, OAuth flows
4. **Technology Agnostic**: No leakage of Next.js, React, tRPC, or Prisma implementation details
5. **Measurable Success**: All criteria have specific metrics (time, percentage, accuracy)
6. **Existing Schema Alignment**: Correctly identifies that Quote and QuoteItem already exist in Prisma schema

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` - No blockers identified

**Recommendations for Planning Phase**:
- Consider localStorage vs sessionStorage trade-offs for cart persistence
- Define cart item naming strategy (prefix extraction from model name)
- Plan middleware for protected routes (/quotes, /quote/[id])
- Design cart state management approach (Context API, Zustand, or server-side session)
