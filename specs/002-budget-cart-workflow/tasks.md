## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion (T001-T007) - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion (T008-T015)
  - User Story 1 (Phase 3): Can start after Foundational
  - User Story 2 (Phase 4): Can start after Foundational (integrates with US1 components)
  - User Story 3 (Phase 5): Can start after Foundational
  - User Story 4 (Phase 6): Depends on US3 auth implementation (T044-T049)
  - User Story 5 (Phase 7): Can start after Foundational
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete (T016-T077)

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Uses CartItem component from US1 but independently testable ‚úÖ
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ
- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Depends on US3 (auth middleware) - Must complete T044-T049 before T055 ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ

### Within Each User Story

- **Tests FIRST**: All contract/unit/integration tests must be written and FAIL before implementation
- **Models before services**: T008-T009 (types) before T055 (service)
- **Services before actions**: T055 (service) before T058 (action)
- **Core implementation before UI**: Actions before page components
- **Story complete before moving to next priority**

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup (Phase 1):**
- T003, T004 (schema updates) can run in parallel
- T006, T007 (backfill scripts) can run in parallel

**Foundational (Phase 2):**
- T009, T011, T012, T014, T015 can all run in parallel (different files)

**User Story 1:**
- T016, T017 (contract tests) can run in parallel
- T018, T019, T020 (unit tests) can run in parallel
- T021, T022, T025 (hook, action, indicator) can run in parallel

**User Story 2:**
- T033, T034, T035 (cart components) can run in parallel
- T037 can run in parallel with UI components

**User Story 3:**
- T042, T043 (integration tests) can run in parallel
- T045, T047 (auth components) can run in parallel

**User Story 4:**
- T052, T053 (contract tests) can run in parallel
- T055, T056 (service, form) can run in parallel

**User Story 5:**
- T065, T066, T067 can all run in parallel (different test files)
- T069, T070, T073 (components) can run in parallel

**Polish (Phase 8):**
- T078, T079, T080, T081, T082, T083 can all run in parallel (different files)

Task T016: "Contract test for addToCartAction in tests/contract/api/cart-actions.test.ts"
Task T017: "Contract test for catalog.calculate-price in tests/contract/api/catalog-price-calculation.test.ts"

# Launch all unit tests for User Story 1 together:

Task T022: "Create cart.actions.ts in src/app/_actions/cart.actions.ts"
Task T025: "Create CartIndicator in src/app/_components/cart-indicator.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 3 + 4 Only)

**Rationale**: Delivers core value - users can build cart, authenticate, and generate quotes

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T007)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T008-T015) - CRITICAL BLOCKER
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T016-T029) - Basic cart functionality
4. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (T042-T051) - Authentication
5. Complete Phase 6: User Story 4 (T052-T064) - Quote generation
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test end-to-end flow independently
7. Deploy/demo MVP

**What's excluded from MVP**: Cart management (US2), Quote history (US5) - These are UX improvements, not core workflow

### Incremental Delivery (All User Stories)

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (T001-T015)
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Basic cart)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Cart management)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Auth required)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Quote generation)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Quote history)
7. Polish ‚Üí Final validation ‚Üí Production release

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers (after Foundational phase completes):

**Team A (Senior)**: User Story 4 (Quote generation) - Most complex, database transactions
**Team B (Mid)**: User Story 1 (Cart add) + User Story 2 (Cart management) - Related features
**Team C (Mid)**: User Story 3 (Auth) + User Story 5 (Quote history) - Auth-related features

Once US1, US3 complete ‚Üí US4 can proceed (depends on auth from US3)

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1-US5)
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **Tests FIRST** (TDD): Verify tests FAIL before implementing features
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at checkpoints to validate story independently
- Avoid vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- **Progressive Enhancement**: All Server Actions must work without JavaScript (form submissions)
- **Price Locking**: Prices locked at quote generation time, not cart add time
- **Cart Persistence**: sessionStorage (cleared on browser close), preserves during OAuth redirect
- **Validation**: End-to-end Zod schemas from client ‚Üí tRPC ‚Üí database

---

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 88
- Setup: 7 tasks
- Foundational: 8 tasks (BLOCKING)
- User Story 1 (P1): 14 tasks
- User Story 2 (P2): 12 tasks
- User Story 3 (P1): 10 tasks
- User Story 4 (P1): 13 tasks
- User Story 5 (P2): 13 tasks
- Polish: 11 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 45 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (51% of total)

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US1: Add item to cart ‚Üí verify auto-generated name ‚Üí verify cart badge updates
- US2: Edit cart items ‚Üí verify real-time totals ‚Üí verify remove works
- US3: Attempt quote generation unauthenticated ‚Üí verify OAuth redirect ‚Üí verify cart preserved
- US4: Generate quote ‚Üí verify database record ‚Üí verify 15-day validity ‚Üí verify cart cleared
- US5: View quote history ‚Üí verify pagination ‚Üí view quote details ‚Üí verify all data correct

**Suggested MVP Scope**: User Stories 1, 3, 4 (29 tasks + 15 foundational/setup = 44 tasks total)

**Estimated Timeline** (1 developer):
- MVP (US1 + US3 + US4): 2-3 weeks
- Full feature (all user stories): 3-4 weeks
- With parallel team (3 devs): 1.5-2 weeks

**Key Risks**:
- OAuth integration complexity (US3) - Mitigation: Use existing NextAuth.js config
- Prisma transaction performance (US4) - Mitigation: Test with realistic data volume
- sessionStorage size limits (US1) - Mitigation: Enforce 20-item cart limit
- Price staleness detection (US4) - Mitigation: Recalculate prices at quote generation, log differences
