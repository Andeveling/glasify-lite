# Specification Quality Checklist: Standardize Glass Suppliers with SOLID Pattern

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-01-21  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### âœ… All Items Pass

**Summary**: Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

**Key Strengths**:
1. **Clear User Stories**: Three prioritized user stories (P1, P1, P2) with independent test descriptions
2. **Comprehensive Requirements**: 25 functional requirements covering all CRUD operations, validation rules, and UX patterns
3. **Measurable Success Criteria**: 11 measurable outcomes with specific time/line count targets
4. **Well-Defined Scope**: Clear boundaries with 13 out-of-scope items for future enhancements
5. **Reference-Based Approach**: Uses Services and Profile Suppliers as proven patterns, reducing implementation risk
6. **Edge Case Coverage**: 10 edge cases with specific handling instructions
7. **Technical Constraints**: 10 constraints ensuring consistency with existing architecture
8. **No Clarifications Needed**: Spec is self-contained based on established patterns

**Comparison with Profile Suppliers (spec 012)**:
- Glass Suppliers has more complexity (8 fields vs 4 fields)
- Additional technical constraints for tenant isolation (TC-008) and referential integrity (TC-010)
- More comprehensive edge case coverage (10 vs 6)
- Similar success criteria adjusted for increased complexity (250 lines vs 200 lines, 120 lines per hook vs 100)

## Notes

- Spec follows exact same structure as 012-simplify-profile-suppliers but adapted for 8-field form
- All 25 functional requirements are testable with clear pass/fail criteria
- Success criteria include both user-facing metrics (time savings) and code quality metrics (line counts)
- Technical constraints ensure consistency with Services and Profile Suppliers patterns
- No implementation details present - spec focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- Ready for planning phase - no additional clarifications needed
