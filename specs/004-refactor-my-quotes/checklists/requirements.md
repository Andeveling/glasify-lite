# Specification Quality Checklist: My Quotes UX Redesign

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-12  
**Feature**: [004-refactor-my-quotes/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### âœ… All Quality Checks Passed

The specification successfully meets all quality criteria:

1. **Content Quality**: The spec avoids technical implementation details (no mention of React, Next.js, specific libraries). It focuses on user outcomes and business value (reducing confusion, improving quote understanding, enabling exports).

2. **Requirement Completeness**: 
   - All 22 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous
   - 8 success criteria are measurable with clear metrics (percentages, time, counts)
   - All success criteria avoid technical details (e.g., "Users can identify status in 90% of cases" instead of "React component renders status correctly")
   - 6 edge cases identified with clear handling expectations
   - Scope boundaries clearly defined in "Out of Scope" section
   - 7 dependencies and 10 assumptions documented

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - Each of the 4 prioritized user stories has complete acceptance scenarios
   - Primary flows covered: viewing quotes, understanding status, visualizing items, exporting
   - All success criteria map to functional requirements
   - Technical Guidance section clearly marked as "optional - for planning phase" to maintain separation

## Notes

- Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- No clarifications needed from user
- All placeholders replaced with concrete details
- User stories prioritized by impact (P1: status clarity & visual items, P2: export, P3: filters)
