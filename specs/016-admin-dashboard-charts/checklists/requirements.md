# Specification Quality Checklist: Dashboard Informativo con Métricas y Charts

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ Content Quality (4/4 passed)
- Specification focuses on business value without technical implementation
- All text is understandable by non-technical stakeholders
- No mention of specific technologies (only shadcn/ui charts as tool, not implementation)
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### ✅ Requirement Completeness (8/8 passed)
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 35 functional requirements are specific and testable
- 10 success criteria defined with measurable metrics
- All 4 user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios
- Edge cases cover common boundary conditions
- Scope clearly defined with "Out of Scope" section
- 8 dependencies and 8 assumptions explicitly documented

### ✅ Feature Readiness (4/4 passed)
- Each functional requirement maps to user stories and acceptance scenarios
- User scenarios prioritized P1-P4 with independent testing criteria
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes (load times, accuracy, usability)
- Specification maintains business language throughout

## Notes

**Specification Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

This specification is complete and ready to proceed to the planning phase using `/speckit.plan`. All quality criteria have been met:

1. **Well-prioritized user stories**: P1 (quotes metrics) → P2 (catalog analysis) → P3 (monetary metrics) → P4 (temporal filters)
2. **Clear RBAC requirements**: Distinguishes admin vs seller permissions throughout
3. **Comprehensive functional requirements**: 35 FRs organized by domain (access, metrics, visualization)
4. **Measurable success criteria**: Performance targets, accuracy guarantees, usability standards
5. **Realistic assumptions**: Acknowledges data volume limits and tenant configuration needs
6. **Explicit dependencies**: Lists required systems (NextAuth, tRPC, Prisma, shadcn/ui)
7. **Well-defined scope**: Clear "Out of Scope" section prevents scope creep

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Run `/speckit.plan` to create technical plan
2. Verify shadcn/ui charts components are installed before implementation
3. Consider creating data seeding strategy for realistic dashboard testing
4. Plan for performance optimization if quote volume exceeds 10,000 records
