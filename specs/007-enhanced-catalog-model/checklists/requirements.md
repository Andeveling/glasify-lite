# Specification Quality Checklist: Enhanced Catalog Model Sidebar Information

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-14  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ All Quality Checks Passed

The specification successfully meets all quality criteria:

1. **Content Quality**: The spec focuses entirely on user needs and business value without mentioning specific technologies (Next.js, tRPC, Prisma, etc. are only referenced in Dependencies section which is appropriate)

2. **Requirements Completeness**: 
   - All 12 functional requirements are testable and specific
   - Success criteria include measurable metrics (3 seconds, 60% reduction, 40% increase, 70% decrease)
   - 5 user stories with acceptance scenarios cover all major flows
   - Edge cases address data availability concerns
   - Scope clearly defined with "Out of Scope" section

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - Each user story has independent test scenarios
   - Stories are prioritized (P1, P2, P3) for incremental delivery
   - Success criteria are user/business focused (session time, error reduction, support ticket reduction)
   - No clarification markers remain - all assumptions documented

4. **Technology Agnostic**: Success criteria focus on user outcomes:
   - "identify supplier within 3 seconds" ✅
   - "60% reduction in validation errors" ✅
   - "40% more quote requests" ✅
   - No mention of API response times, database queries, or framework internals ✅

## Notes

- Feature is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- No clarifications needed from stakeholders
- Assumptions section clearly documents current system limitations (e.g., performance ratings not in schema yet)
- Dependencies appropriately reference existing technical components only where necessary for implementation planning
