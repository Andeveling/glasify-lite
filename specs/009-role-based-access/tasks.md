  - ‚úÖ VERIFIED: Middleware redirects user role from `/dashboard` to `/my-quotes` (line 37-46)
  - ‚úÖ VERIFIED: tRPC procedures use `getQuoteFilter` preventing access to other users' quotes
  - ‚úÖ VERIFIED: quote.get-by-id has ownership check (T025) blocking unauthorized access
  - **Results Documented**:
    - ‚úÖ Client flow unbroken: catalog browsing ‚Üí signin ‚Üí my-quotes
    - ‚úÖ Users see only their own quotes (role-based filtering)
    - ‚úÖ No access to admin routes (middleware protection)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (Phase 1) completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) completion
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) completion - can run parallel with US1
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) completion - can run parallel with US1/US2
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US1, US2, US3 navigation routes existing
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) completion - can run parallel with other stories
- **Testing (Phase 8)**: Can run in parallel with implementation or after
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (Admin Dashboard - P1)**: Independent - can start after Foundational
- **US2 (Seller Access - P2)**: Independent - can start after Foundational (parallel with US1)
- **US3 (Client Access - P1)**: Independent - mostly verification of existing code
- **US4 (Role-Based Navigation - P2)**: Depends on US1, US2, US3 routes existing
- **US5 (Database Role Management - P3)**: Independent - can start after Foundational

### Critical Path (MVP - User Story 1 Only)

```
Setup (T001-T004) 
  ‚Üí Foundational (T005-T010) 
  ‚Üí US1: Admin Dashboard (T011-T021)
  ‚Üí Testing for US1 (T045)
  ‚Üí Polish (T048-T057)
```

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**:
- T003 (NextAuth config) can run parallel with T001-T002 (database migration)
- T004 (Prisma generate) runs after T001 completes

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T006, T007, T008 (tRPC helpers) can all run in parallel
- T009, T010 (guard components) can run in parallel with tRPC helpers

**Phase 3 (US1)**:
- T012, T013, T014, T015, T019 (all [P] marked) can run in parallel
- T016, T017 can run after T020 (depends on admin procedure)

**Phase 4-7 (User Stories)**:
- US1, US2, US3, US5 can all start in parallel after Phase 2 completes (different features)
- US4 starts after US1-US3 have routes created

**Phase 8 (Testing)**:
- All test tasks (T040-T047) can run in parallel

**Phase 9 (Polish)**:
- T048, T049, T050, T052, T053 (documentation, lint, types) can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# After Setup (Phase 1) completes, launch these together:

# Terminal 1: Middleware
Task T005: Implement middleware role verification logic

# Terminal 2: tRPC helpers (all parallel)
Task T006: Create adminProcedure helper
Task T007: Create sellerProcedure helper
Task T008: Create getQuoteFilter helper

# Terminal 3: Guard components (parallel)
Task T009: Create AdminOnly component
Task T010: Create SellerOnly component
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story Implementation

```bash
# After Foundational (Phase 2) completes, launch user stories in parallel:

# Developer A: US1 (Admin Dashboard - Priority P1)
Task T011-T021: Admin dashboard implementation

# Developer B: US2 (Seller Access - Priority P2)
Task T022-T026: Seller quotes dashboard

# Developer C: US3 (Client Access - Priority P1)
Task T027-T029: Verify client flow

# Developer D: US5 (Database Roles - Priority P3)
Task T035-T039: User management backend
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 + User Story 3)

**Goal**: Deliver working admin dashboard while maintaining existing client flow

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (database migration, NextAuth config)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (middleware, tRPC helpers, guards) - **CRITICAL**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Admin Dashboard)
4. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Verify Client Flow)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test admin and client flows independently
6. Run core tests: T045 (admin E2E), T047 (client E2E)
7. Deploy/demo if ready

**MVP Deliverables**:
- ‚úÖ Admins can manage system (models, quotes, settings)
- ‚úÖ Clients maintain existing workflow (unbroken)
- ‚úÖ Role-based access enforced at middleware and tRPC layers

### Incremental Delivery (Full Feature)

1. **Foundation** (Phases 1-2): Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. **MVP** (Phases 3 + 5): Admin Dashboard + Client Verification ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
3. **Seller Role** (Phase 4): Add seller access ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. **Enhanced UX** (Phase 6): Role-based navigation ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. **User Management** (Phase 7): Database role management ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. **Quality** (Phases 8-9): Tests + Polish ‚Üí Final release

Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy (4 Developers)

**Sprint 1: Foundation (Week 1)**
- All developers work together on Phases 1-2 (pair programming recommended)
- **Checkpoint**: Foundation complete, all tests pass

**Sprint 2: User Stories (Week 2)**
- Developer A: US1 (Admin Dashboard - P1)
- Developer B: US2 (Seller Access - P2)
- Developer C: US3 (Client Verification - P1)
- Developer D: US5 (User Management Backend - P3)
- **Checkpoint**: All stories independently functional

**Sprint 3: Integration & Polish (Week 3)**
- Developer A: US4 (Role-Based Navigation - P2)
- Developer B: Testing (Phase 8)
- Developer C + D: Polish (Phase 9)
- **Checkpoint**: Feature complete, all tests passing

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **Constitution compliance**: 
  - Server Components by default ‚úÖ
  - Winston logger server-side only ‚úÖ
  - SOLID principles ‚úÖ
  - Spanish UI text, English code/comments ‚úÖ
- **Each user story**: Independently completable and testable
- **Stop at checkpoints**: Validate each story independently before continuing
- **Commit strategy**: Commit after each task or logical group
- **Avoid**: Vague tasks, same-file conflicts, cross-story dependencies

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 57
**User Stories**: 5
**Parallel Opportunities**: 32 tasks marked [P]
**Estimated MVP Scope**: Phases 1-3 + Phase 5 (Setup + Foundational + US1 + US3) = ~25 tasks
**Critical Path**: Setup ‚Üí Foundational (BLOCKS all) ‚Üí US1 ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Polish

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- **US1**: Admin login ‚Üí access dashboard ‚Üí manage models/quotes ‚Üí configure settings ‚úÖ
- **US2**: Seller login ‚Üí access own quotes ‚Üí blocked from admin routes ‚úÖ
- **US3**: Client login ‚Üí access own quotes ‚Üí catalog browsing ‚Üí blocked from admin ‚úÖ
- **US4**: Each role sees appropriate navigation menu ‚úÖ
- **US5**: Admin can update user roles via tRPC (UI placeholder) ‚úÖ
