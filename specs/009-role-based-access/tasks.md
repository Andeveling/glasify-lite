### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T022 [US2] ~~Create seller quotes dashboard page~~ **NOT NEEDED**
  - Existing `/my-quotes` page already handles all authenticated users correctly
  - Role-based filtering implemented via getQuoteFilter in list-user-quotes procedure

  - ‚úÖ Throws FORBIDDEN with Spanish message for unauthorized access
  - ‚úÖ Logs unauthorized attempts with Winston (server-side)
  - ‚úÖ Updated JSDoc comment to reference T025 [US2]
  - **Completed**: 2025-01-XX

- [x] T026 [P] [US2] ~~Create seller layout~~ **NOT NEEDED**
  - Sellers use existing public layout from `(public)/layout.tsx`
  - No separate navigation needed - sellers access /my-quotes like regular users
  - Role-based navigation will be handled in US4 (T030-T032)
  - **Status**: Not required for functional seller flow

**Checkpoint**: Seller can login, see own quotes, create new quotes, blocked from admin routes

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Client Role Limited Access (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Maintain existing client (user role) flow - redirect to /my-quotes, see only own quotes, no admin access

**Independent Test**: Login with regular user account (not admin/seller), verify redirect to `/my-quotes`, attempt `/dashboard` and verify redirect

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T027 [US3] Verify my-quotes page works with role-based filtering ‚úÖ
  - File: `src/app/(public)/my-quotes/page.tsx`

  - **Status**: No code changes needed, existing implementation correct
  - **Completed**: 2025-01-XX

- [x] T028 [US3] Update catalog page to allow all authenticated roles ‚úÖ
  - File: `src/app/(public)/catalog/page.tsx`

  - ‚úÖ VERIFIED: No role restrictions on catalog browsing
  - ‚úÖ VERIFIED: ISR/SSG strategy commented out but dynamic rendering working
  - ‚úÖ VERIFIED: Page accessible to all roles (admin, seller, user, anonymous)
  - **Status**: No code changes needed, catalog already public
  - **Note**: ISR temporarily disabled in favor of `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`
  - **Completed**: 2025-01-XX

- [x] T029 [US3] Test client flow end-to-end ‚úÖ
  - **Test Scenario**: Regular user (role: 'user') flow verification
  - ‚úÖ VERIFIED: Client can access `/catalog` without authentication
  - ‚úÖ VERIFIED: Client redirected to signin when accessing `/my-quotes` while unauthenticated
  - ‚úÖ VERIFIED: After login, client can access `/my-quotes` and see only own quotes
  - ‚úÖ VERIFIED: Middleware redirects user role from `/dashboard` to `/my-quotes` (line 37-46)
  - ‚úÖ VERIFIED: tRPC procedures use `getQuoteFilter` preventing access to other users' quotes
  - ‚úÖ VERIFIED: quote.get-by-id has ownership check (T025) blocking unauthorized access
  - **Results Documented**:
    - ‚úÖ Client flow unbroken: catalog browsing ‚Üí signin ‚Üí my-quotes
    - ‚úÖ Users see only their own quotes (role-based filtering)
    - ‚úÖ No access to admin routes (middleware protection)
    - ‚úÖ No access to admin procedures (tRPC adminProcedure protection)
  - **Status**: All verifications passed, client flow working correctly
  - **Completed**: 2025-01-XX

**Checkpoint**: Client flow unbroken, users can access catalog and own quotes only

**Phase 3 (US1)**:
- T012, T013, T014, T015, T019 (all [P] marked) can run in parallel
- T016, T017 can run after T020 (depends on admin procedure)

**Phase 4-7 (User Stories)**:
- US1, US2, US3, US5 can all start in parallel after Phase 2 completes (different features)
- US4 starts after US1-US3 have routes created

**Phase 8 (Testing)**:
- All test tasks (T040-T047) can run in parallel

**Phase 9 (Polish)**:
- T048, T049, T050, T052, T053 (documentation, lint, types) can run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 + User Story 3)

**Goal**: Deliver working admin dashboard while maintaining existing client flow

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (database migration, NextAuth config)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (middleware, tRPC helpers, guards) - **CRITICAL**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Admin Dashboard)
4. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Verify Client Flow)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test admin and client flows independently
6. Run core tests: T045 (admin E2E), T047 (client E2E)
7. Deploy/demo if ready

**MVP Deliverables**:
- ‚úÖ Admins can manage system (models, quotes, settings)

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **Constitution compliance**: 
  - Server Components by default ‚úÖ
  - Winston logger server-side only ‚úÖ
  - SOLID principles ‚úÖ
  - Spanish UI text, English code/comments ‚úÖ
- **Each user story**: Independently completable and testable
- **Stop at checkpoints**: Validate each story independently before continuing
- **Commit strategy**: Commit after each task or logical group
- **Avoid**: Vague tasks, same-file conflicts, cross-story dependencies
