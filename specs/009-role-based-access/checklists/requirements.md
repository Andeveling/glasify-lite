# Specification Quality Checklist: Role-Based Access Control System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 14 de octubre de 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Specification focuses on user flows and business value (admin management, seller workflows, client access)
- ✅ No mention of specific React components, Next.js implementation details, or code structure
- ✅ Language is clear and understandable for business stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present in the specification
- ✅ All functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-021) are testable with clear acceptance criteria
- ✅ Success criteria include specific metrics (2 seconds, 100% prevention, 1.5 seconds, 95% direct access)
- ✅ Success criteria focus on user outcomes, not technical implementation (e.g., "Administradores pueden acceder al dashboard completo en menos de 2 segundos" instead of "React components load in 2 seconds")
- ✅ Each user story has specific Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios
- ✅ Edge cases section covers 6 critical scenarios (role changes during active session, null roles, multiple admins, direct URL access, session expiration, role degradation)
- ✅ "Out of Scope" section clearly defines what is NOT included (user management UI, granular permissions, audit logs, etc.)
- ✅ Dependencies and Assumptions sections clearly identify what the feature relies on (NextAuth.js v5, existing middleware, Prisma schema, etc.)

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Each of the 21 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-021) has specific, testable acceptance criteria
- ✅ User stories cover all primary flows:
  - P1: Admin dashboard access (critical for system management)
  - P2: Seller role access control (revenue-generating users)
  - P1: Client limited access (existing MVP flow)
  - P2: Role-based navigation UI (UX improvement)
  - P3: Database-based role management (future flexibility)
- ✅ Success criteria (SC-001 to SC-007) provide measurable outcomes:
  - Performance targets (2 seconds, 1.5 seconds)
  - Security guarantees (100% prevention of unauthorized access)
  - User experience metrics (95% direct access, 100% session handling)
- ✅ Specification maintains technology-agnostic language throughout, focusing on what the system should do, not how it should be implemented

## Notes

**Status**: ✅ SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready to proceed to the `/speckit.plan` phase.

**Key Strengths**:
1. Clear prioritization of user stories with independent testability
2. Comprehensive edge case coverage addressing real-world scenarios
3. Well-defined scope boundaries (Out of Scope section)
4. Strong security considerations section
5. Detailed technical notes for planning phase (without leaking implementation into main spec)
6. Measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria

**Recommendations for Planning Phase**:
1. Start with P1 user stories (Admin Dashboard Access, Client Limited Access) as they represent core value
2. Reference the "Technical Notes for Planning Phase" section when creating implementation tasks
3. Ensure database migration includes rollback script as specified in Constraints
4. Consider creating separate implementation plans for middleware enhancement vs UI components
