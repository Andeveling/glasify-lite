# Specification Quality Checklist: Galería de Diseños 2D para Modelos

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-01-25  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Issues

### Round 1 - Initial Check (2025-01-25 10:30)

**Content Quality**: ❌ FAIL
- Issue: FR-001 mentions "Konva React" (implementation detail)
- Issue: Dependencies section lists specific libraries (Konva.js, react-konva)
- Issue: SC-004 mentions "Konva" directly
- Note: While the user specified Konva in their request, the spec should remain technology-agnostic where possible

**Requirement Completeness**: ❌ FAIL
- Issue: 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present:
  1. Edge Cases: "¿Los diseños se escalan proporcionalmente o tienen dimensiones fijas?"
  2. Edge Cases: "¿El material afecta el rendering visual?"
  3. FR-008: "¿Qué validaciones son necesarias? ¿Dimensiones mínimas/máximas?"

**Feature Readiness**: ⚠️ PARTIAL
- User scenarios are well-defined and prioritized
- Success criteria are measurable but some are technology-specific

**Action Taken**: Presented 3 clarification questions to user

---

### Round 2 - After Clarifications (2025-01-25 10:45)

**User Responses**:
- Q1: Option C - Diseños se adaptan dinámicamente (rendering parametrizado)
- Q2: Option C - Material afecta color básico (gris/blanco/marrón/neutro)
- Q3: Option C - Validar tipo de modelo compatible (categorización)

**Changes Applied**:
- ✅ Replaced all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers with concrete answers
- ✅ Added FR-013 to FR-018 for adaptive rendering, material colors, and type validation
- ✅ Updated Key Entities to include model type and material color mapping
- ✅ Added SC-007, SC-008, SC-009 for new capabilities
- ✅ Refined Edge Cases with specific scenarios
- ✅ Updated Assumptions to reflect parametric design system
- ✅ Abstracted technology references in functional requirements (FR-001 now says "canvas 2D" not "Konva")
- ✅ Updated User Story 2 with type validation scenarios

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS
- All functional requirements are technology-agnostic
- Dependencies section appropriately lists technical choices separate from requirements
- No implementation details in core specification sections

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASS
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- All requirements are testable (FR-008 now specifies type matching validation)
- Success criteria are measurable and specific (SC-007, SC-008, SC-009)
- All acceptance scenarios are well-defined with Given/When/Then
- Edge cases comprehensively identify boundary conditions
- Scope clearly bounded with Out of Scope section
- 11 assumptions documented, 5 dependencies listed

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS
- 18 functional requirements with clear acceptance criteria
- 3 user stories prioritized and independently testable
- 9 measurable success criteria defined
- No implementation details leak into specification (abstractions used: "canvas 2D", "geometric structures", etc.)

## Summary

✅ **SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING**

All quality checklist items have passed validation. The specification is:
- Complete with all mandatory sections
- Clear and unambiguous (no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers)
- Technology-agnostic in requirements (implementation details isolated to Dependencies)
- Testable with well-defined acceptance criteria
- Measurable with 9 specific success criteria

**Next Steps**:
- Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
- Or use `/speckit.clarify` if additional stakeholder input needed

**Feature Metrics**:
- 3 prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3)
- 18 functional requirements
- 9 success criteria
- 7 edge cases identified
- 11 assumptions documented
- 3 key entities defined
