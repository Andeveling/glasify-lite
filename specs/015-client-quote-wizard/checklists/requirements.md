# Specification Quality Checklist: Client Quote Wizard

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-28  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All quality criteria met

### Details:

1. **Content Quality**: ✅ PASS
   - Specification focuses on user needs (wizard for end customers to reduce cognitive load)
   - No implementation-specific details (no mention of specific React patterns, tRPC implementation details, etc.)
   - Written in plain language accessible to business stakeholders
   - All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

2. **Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASS
   - Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (all requirements are specific)
   - All functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-016) are testable (e.g., FR-010 specifies exact dimension constraints: 500-3000mm)
   - Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (e.g., SC-001: "under 3 minutes", SC-002: "below 15%")
   - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "users complete quotation" not "React component renders")
   - All 4 user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios using Given/When/Then format
   - Edge cases section covers 5 specific scenarios (dimension validation, unavailable solutions, network failures, etc.)
   - Out of Scope section clearly defines boundaries (no multi-language, no analytics, etc.)
   - Dependencies section lists all external requirements (react-hook-form, tRPC procedures, etc.)
   - Assumptions section documents 9 key assumptions (e.g., localStorage availability, mobile traffic %, etc.)

3. **Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS
   - Each functional requirement maps to user stories (e.g., FR-001 enables US1, FR-007 enables US3)
   - User stories cover primary flows: basic wizard completion (P1), navigation (P2), persistence (P3), mobile (P2)
   - Success criteria are independently verifiable without implementation knowledge
   - File Organization section documents structure but doesn't prescribe implementation (SOLID principles guide, not code)

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- No clarifications needed from user - all requirements are well-defined
- Consider validating glass solution data quality (noted in Risks & Mitigations) before implementation starts
- Mobile optimization (US4) may require dedicated UX testing phase
