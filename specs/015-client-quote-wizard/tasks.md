# Tasks: Client Quote Wizard

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/015-client-quote-wizard/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/wizard-api.md, quickstart.md

**Constitution Compliance**: Tasks follow principles from `.specify/memory/constitution.md`:
- **Flexible Testing**: Tests written during implementation, all features tested before merge
- **One Job, One Place**: Each task has single responsibility with clear file path
- **Clarity Over Complexity**: Descriptive task names following project conventions
- **Security From the Start**: Validation and authorization included in all data entry points

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.
