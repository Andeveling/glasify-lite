**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-13  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Outstanding Clarifications

âœ… **All clarifications resolved:**

1. **FR-015** (Notification Strategy): **RESOLVED** - Database status update only in MVP; no automated notifications. Vendor checks system manually. Future integrations with CRM and WhatsApp Business planned.

2. **FR-016** (Quote Withdrawal): **RESOLVED** - No withdrawal capability. Submission is final. Users must contact vendor directly to cancel. This maintains vendor trust and simplifies MVP.

## Notes

- Spec is well-structured with 4 prioritized user stories
- Edge cases are comprehensive and realistic (9 cases identified)
- Success criteria include both quantitative metrics and qualitative outcomes
- Assumptions section clearly documents context and constraints
- Out of scope section prevents feature creep and documents future roadmap (CRM/WhatsApp integrations)
- MVP approach prioritizes core functionality - advanced features deferred to post-MVP
- User Story 3 updated to include guidance for users who need to cancel (contact vendor directly)
