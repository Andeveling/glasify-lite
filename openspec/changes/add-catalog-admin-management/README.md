# OpenSpec Change Proposal: Catalog Admin Management

## 📋 Summary

Successfully created a comprehensive OpenSpec change proposal for **complete catalog administration** in Glasify Lite.

## 🎯 What Was Created

### 1. Core Documentation
- ✅ **proposal.md** - Executive summary, motivation, goals, risks, timeline
- ✅ **design.md** - Technical architecture, component design, database patterns
- ✅ **tasks.md** - 53 ordered implementation tasks across 7 phases (~7 weeks)

### 2. Capability Specifications (6 specs)
- ✅ **model-management** - Full CRUD + publish/unpublish (6 requirements, 12 scenarios)
- ✅ **glass-type-management** - CRUD + solutions/characteristics (6 requirements, 9 scenarios)
- ✅ **glass-solution-management** - CRUD + reordering (5 requirements, 5 scenarios)
- ✅ **glass-characteristic-management** - CRUD + category filtering (4 requirements, 4 scenarios)
- ✅ **glass-supplier-management** - CRUD + dependency protection (4 requirements, 4 scenarios)
- ✅ **service-management** - CRUD + type/unit filtering (4 requirements, 4 scenarios)

## 📊 Statistics

- **Total Requirements**: 29 ADDED requirements
- **Total Scenarios**: 38 scenario-based acceptance tests
- **Implementation Tasks**: 53 tasks organized in 7 phases
- **Estimated Timeline**: 35 working days (~7 weeks)
- **Affected Entities**: 12 database models
- **New tRPC Routers**: 6 admin routers
- **New UI Pages**: 6 dashboard pages

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Backend (tRPC + Prisma)
- **Admin-only procedures** using `adminProcedure` for authorization
- **Referential integrity** checks before deletions
- **Price history tracking** for models and glass types
- **Audit logging** with Winston (server-side only)
- **Database transactions** for complex operations

### Frontend (Next.js 15 + React Server Components)
- **Server Component pages** with client-side interactivity delegation
- **Reusable components**: DataTable, DeleteConfirmationDialog, FormFields
- **Progressive disclosure** for complex forms (glass types)
- **Optimistic UI updates** (future enhancement)

### Data Integrity
- **Dependency checking** prevents orphaned records
- **Uniqueness validation** for names, SKUs, codes
- **Cascade rules** for related record deletion
- **Soft delete option** (configurable)

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

- ✅ **RBAC enforcement** - All mutations require admin role
- ✅ **Middleware protection** - `/dashboard/*` routes blocked for non-admins
- ✅ **Input validation** - Zod schemas with Spanish error messages
- ✅ **Audit trail** - All mutations logged with user attribution
- ✅ **No Winston in client** - Server-side logging only

## 📝 Key Features

### For Administrators
1. **Model Management**
   - Create/edit window/door models with pricing and dimensions
   - Publish/unpublish for catalog visibility control
   - Assign compatible glass types
   - Track price history

2. **Glass Type Management**
   - Create glass products with technical specs
   - Assign to multiple solutions (security, thermal, etc.)
   - Tag with characteristics (tempered, laminated, low-e)
   - Track pricing history

3. **Supporting Entity Management**
   - Glass solutions (security, thermal, acoustic, decorative)
   - Glass characteristics (tempered, laminated, low-e, etc.)
   - Glass suppliers (Guardian, Saint-Gobain, Pilkington)
   - Services (installation, measurement, delivery)

4. **Bulk Operations** (Phase 6)
   - Import catalog data from JSON
   - Export catalog for backup/migration
   - Validate before import (atomic transactions)

## ✅ Validation Status

```bash
openspec validate add-catalog-admin-management --strict
# ✅ Change 'add-catalog-admin-management' is valid
```

All requirements comply with OpenSpec standards:
- ✅ Every requirement contains MUST/SHALL
- ✅ Every requirement has at least one scenario
- ✅ Scenarios follow GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format
- ✅ Acceptance criteria clearly defined

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Review & Approval**
   - Share proposal with stakeholders
   - Gather feedback on scope and timeline
   - Adjust requirements if needed

2. **Implementation**
   - Start with Phase 1 (shared infrastructure)
   - Follow tasks sequentially within each phase
   - Run tests after each major milestone

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests: 80%+ coverage target
   - Integration tests: All tRPC procedures
   - E2E tests: Critical admin workflows
   - Manual QA: UI/UX validation

4. **Deployment**
   - Migrate existing `model-upsert` to new router
   - Seed initial catalog data (solutions, characteristics)
   - Update dashboard navigation
   - Deploy with feature flag (optional)

- ✅ RBAC patterns (defense-in-depth)
- ✅ Winston server-side only rule
- ✅ Spanish UI text, English code/comments
- ✅ Conventional commits format
- ✅ OpenSpec spec-driven development

## 📞 Questions & Clarifications

If you have questions about:
- **Scope**: Review `proposal.md` - Non-goals section
- **Architecture**: Review `design.md` - Component architecture
- **Implementation**: Review `tasks.md` - 53 ordered tasks
- **Requirements**: Review individual spec files in `specs/`
