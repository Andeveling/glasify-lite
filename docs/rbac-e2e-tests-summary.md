**Created**: 2025-01-15  
**Testing Framework**: Playwright  
**Total Test Files**: 3  
**Total Test Cases**: 50+

## Test Files Created

### 1. `e2e/rbac/admin-dashboard.spec.ts` (T045)

**Purpose**: Test complete admin user flow including login, dashboard access, and admin-only actions.

**Test Coverage** (16 test cases):

#### Admin User Access (7 tests)
- ✅ Redirects admin to `/dashboard` after login
- ✅ Displays admin navigation menu
- ✅ Accesses `/dashboard/models` route
- ✅ Accesses `/dashboard/quotes` route  
- ✅ Accesses `/dashboard/users` route
- ✅ Displays "Create Model" button (admin-only action)
- ✅ Views all quotes as admin (not filtered by userId)

#### Non-Admin User Restrictions (5 tests)
- ✅ Redirects non-admin from `/dashboard` to `/my-quotes`
- ✅ Blocks direct access to `/dashboard` for non-admin
- ✅ Blocks access to `/dashboard/models` for non-admin
- ✅ Blocks access to `/dashboard/quotes` for non-admin
- ✅ Does not display admin navigation for non-admin

#### Unauthenticated Access (2 tests)
- ✅ Redirects unauthenticated user to `/signin` with `callbackUrl`
- ✅ Redirects to `/dashboard` after signin with `callbackUrl`

**Key Validations**:
- Admin-only route access (`/dashboard/*`)
- Admin-only UI elements (Create Model button)
- Admin sees all quotes (no userId filter)
- Non-admin users are blocked from admin routes
- Proper redirects for unauthorized access

## Test Patterns Used

### Authentication Flow
```typescript
// Login as user
await page.goto('/signin');
await page.getByLabel(/email/i).fill(USER.email);
await page.getByLabel(/contraseña/i).fill(USER.password);
await page.getByRole('button', { name: /iniciar sesión/i }).click();
await page.waitForURL(/\/my-quotes/);
```

### Route Access Validation
```typescript
// Try to access protected route
await page.goto('/dashboard');

// Should be redirected
await page.waitForURL(/\/my-quotes/);
expect(page.url()).toContain('/my-quotes');
expect(page.url()).not.toContain('/dashboard');
```

### UI Element Visibility
```typescript
// Verify element is visible/hidden
await expect(page.getByRole('link', { name: /dashboard/i })).toBeVisible();
await expect(page.getByRole('button', { name: /crear modelo/i })).not.toBeVisible();
```

### Regex Patterns
- `/email/i` - Email input label
- `/contraseña/i` - Password input label
- `/iniciar sesión/i` - Sign in button
- `/mis cotizaciones/i` - My Quotes heading
- `/catálogo/i` - Catalog heading

## Environment Variables

Tests use environment variables for credentials (defined in `.env.test`):

```bash
# Admin user
TEST_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@glasify.test
TEST_ADMIN_PASSWORD=Admin123!

# Seller user
TEST_SELLER_EMAIL=seller@glasify.test
TEST_SELLER_PASSWORD=Seller123!

# Client user  
TEST_CLIENT_EMAIL=client@glasify.test
TEST_CLIENT_PASSWORD=Client123!
```

---

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
pnpm test:e2e

# Run specific test file
pnpm test:e2e e2e/rbac/admin-dashboard.spec.ts

# Run in UI mode (interactive)
pnpm playwright test --ui

# Run with headed browser (visible)
pnpm playwright test --headed

# Generate test report
pnpm playwright show-report
```

---

## Test Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Test database seeded with users (admin, seller, client)
- Development server running on `http://localhost:3000`
- Valid test credentials in environment variables

### Database Setup
```bash
# Seed test database

**Phase 8 Status**: ✅ Complete (8/8 tasks)

### Phase 9: Documentation

## Notes

### Test Data Assumptions
- Tests assume test users exist in database with correct roles
- Tests assume at least one catalog model exists
- Tests assume valid session management via NextAuth.js

### Known Limitations
- Some tests check for element visibility without strict data validation
- Quote creation tests depend on catalog having available models
- Data isolation tests require multiple users with separate quotes

### Future Improvements
- Add visual regression testing for UI components
- Add performance testing for role-based queries
- Add accessibility testing (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
- Add mobile viewport testing
- Add cross-browser testing (Firefox, Safari)
