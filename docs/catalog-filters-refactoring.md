# Catalog Filter Components - SOLID Refactoring

## Overview
Refactored catalog filter components following SOLID principles to eliminate code duplication and improve maintainability.

## Problem
The original `CatalogFilters` component violated the **Single Responsibility Principle** by handling multiple concerns:
- Filter controls rendering (selects)
- Active filter badges display
- Result count display

This led to:
- Code duplication when using the component in different configurations
- Poor separation of concerns
- Difficult to test individual pieces
- Violation of DRY principle

## Solution
Applied **Single Responsibility Principle** and **Open/Closed Principle** by extracting responsibilities into specialized components:

### Component Architecture

```
CatalogFilterBar (Composition)
├── CatalogSearch (Search input)
└── CatalogFilters (Filter orchestrator)
    ├── ActiveFilterBadges (Badge display)
    └── ResultCount (Result count display)
```

### New Components

#### 1. `ActiveFilterBadges`
**Responsibility**: Display active filter badges with removal actions

```typescript
type ActiveFilterBadgesProps = {
  selectedManufacturerName?: string | null;
  onRemoveManufacturer?: () => void;
};
```

**Benefits**:
- Single responsibility: Only badge display logic
- Reusable across different filter contexts
- Easy to test in isolation
- Clear props contract

#### 2. `ResultCount`
**Responsibility**: Display filtered result count with proper Spanish pluralization

```typescript
type ResultCountProps = {
  totalResults?: number;
};
```

**Benefits**:
- Single responsibility: Only result count display
- Handles all pluralization cases (0, 1, n)
- Can be used independently of filters
- Presentation logic separated from business logic

#### 3. `CatalogFilters` (Refactored)
**Responsibility**: Orchestrate filter controls and delegate display to subcomponents

```typescript
type CatalogFiltersProps = {
  manufacturers?: Array<{ id: string; name: string }>;
  totalResults?: number;
  showControls?: boolean;    // Toggle filter selects
  showBadges?: boolean;       // Toggle active badges
  showResultCount?: boolean;  // Toggle result count
};
```

**Benefits**:
- Composition over duplication
- Configurable through props
- Open for extension, closed for modification
- Clear delegation to specialized components

#### 4. `CatalogFilterBar` (Updated)
**Responsibility**: Layout composition of search and filter components

**Benefits**:
- Grid-based responsive layout
- Clear separation: Row 1 (controls), Row 2 (badges + count)
- Uses composition instead of duplication

## SOLID Principles Applied

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) ✅
Each component has one clear reason to change:
- `ActiveFilterBadges`: Changes when badge display logic changes
- `ResultCount`: Changes when result count display logic changes
- `CatalogFilters`: Changes when filter orchestration logic changes
- `CatalogFilterBar`: Changes when layout requirements change

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP) ✅
Components are:
- **Open for extension**: New filter types can be added to `ActiveFilterBadges`
- **Closed for modification**: Existing components don't need changes for new features

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) ✅
- Components depend on abstractions (props interface)
- High-level `CatalogFilters` delegates to low-level display components
- Loose coupling through clear contracts

### Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) ✅
- Eliminated duplicate rendering of badges and result count
- Single source of truth for each UI concern
- Reusable components across the application

## Usage Examples

### Show only filter controls (no badges or count)
```tsx
<CatalogFilters 
  manufacturers={manufacturers}
  showBadges={false}
  showResultCount={false}
/>
```

### Show only badges and result count (no controls)
```tsx
<CatalogFilters 
  manufacturers={manufacturers}
  totalResults={totalResults}
  showControls={false}
/>
```

### Show all features (default)
```tsx
<CatalogFilters 
  manufacturers={manufacturers}
  totalResults={totalResults}
/>
```

### Independent badge usage
```tsx
<ActiveFilterBadges
  selectedManufacturerName="VEKA"
  onRemoveManufacturer={handleRemove}
/>
```

## File Structure
```
src/app/(public)/catalog/_components/
├── active-filter-badges.tsx   # Badge display component
├── catalog-filter-bar.tsx     # Layout composition
├── catalog-filters.tsx        # Filter orchestrator
├── catalog-search.tsx         # Search component
└── result-count.tsx          # Result count component
```

## Testing Benefits
Each component can now be tested independently:
- Mock fewer dependencies
- Test specific behaviors in isolation
- Easier to maintain test suites
- Clear test boundaries

## Performance
- No barrel files (avoided for better tree-shaking)
- Direct imports maintain optimal bundle size
- Memoized callbacks prevent unnecessary re-renders
- URL-based state management (no prop drilling)

## Future Enhancements
Components are now positioned for easy extension:
- Add new filter types (price range, glass type, etc.)
- Add sorting badge display
- Implement filter presets
- Add filter analytics/tracking
- Support filter persistence

## Migration Path
No breaking changes to existing usage. `CatalogFilterBar` maintains the same public API.
