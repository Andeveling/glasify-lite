# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

**Note**: This specification must comply with project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`). The implementation plan (`plan.md`) will perform detailed constitution checks.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

### File Organization *(include if feature involves forms/components)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: If feature includes forms or complex components, document
  the expected file organization following SOLID architecture principles.
  Reference: constitution.md - "One Job, One Place (SOLID Architecture)"
-->

For each form/complex component, structure must follow:
```
feature/
├── _components/
│   └── feature-form.tsx          # UI orchestration only (target <100 lines)
├── _hooks/
│   ├── use-feature-mutations.ts  # API mutations + cache invalidation
│   └── use-feature-data.ts       # Data fetching with stale time
├── _schemas/
│   └── feature-form.schema.ts    # Zod validation schema
├── _utils/
│   └── feature-form.utils.ts     # getDefaults(), transform(), types
└── _constants/
    └── feature-form.constants.ts # Extracted magic numbers
```

**SOLID Requirements**:
- Single Responsibility: Each file has one clear purpose
- No magic numbers in components (extract to constants)
- No inline schemas (extract to _schemas/)
- No mutation logic in UI (extract to _hooks/)
- No hardcoded defaults (extract to _utils/)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]
